tests:
  - name: row_count_equal_to_source_file
    description:
      "This test verifies that the row count in the given model matches the expected row count from the source file. It dynamically determines how to read the source based on the file extension:\n
          - `.json` uses `read_json` and subtracts 1 from the count.\n
          - `.csv` and `.txt` use `read_csv`.\n
          - `.shp` uses `ST_read`.\n
          - Other formats are read directly from the compiled source reference.\n\n
      If there is a mismatch between the actual row count and the expected row count, the test will fail."
