shape_id,ID,Required,Identifies a shape.
shape_pt_lat,Latitude,Required,Latitude of a shape point. Each record in shapes.txt represents a shape point used to define the shape.
shape_pt_lon,Longitude,Required,Longitude of a shape point.
shape_pt_sequence,Non-negative integer,Required,"Sequence in which the shape points connect to form the shape. Values must increase along the trip but do not need to be consecutive.Example: If the shape ""A_shp"" has three points in its definition, the shapes.txt file might contain these records to define the shape:  shape_id,shape_pt_lat,shape_pt_lon,shape_pt_sequence  A_shp,37.61956,-122.48161,0  A_shp,37.64430,-122.41070,6  A_shp,37.65863,-122.30839,11"
shape_dist_traveled,Non-negative float,Optional,"Actual distance traveled along the shape from the first shape point to the point specified in this record. Used by trip planners to show the correct portion of the shape on a map. Values must increase along with shape_pt_sequence; they must not be used to show reverse travel along a route. Distance units must be consistent with those used in stop_times.txt.Recommended for routes that have looping or inlining (the vehicle crosses or travels over the same portion of alignment in one trip). If a vehicle retraces or crosses the route alignment at points in the course of a trip, shape_dist_traveled is important to clarify how portions of the points in shapes.txt line up correspond with records in stop_times.txt.Example: If a bus travels along the three points defined above for A_shp, the additional shape_dist_traveled values (shown here in kilometers) would look like this:  shape_id,shape_pt_lat,shape_pt_lon,shape_pt_sequence,shape_dist_traveledA_shp,37.61956,-122.48161,0,0A_shp,37.64430,-122.41070,6,6.8310  A_shp,37.65863,-122.30839,11,15.8765 https://gtfs.org/assets/inlining.svg"
