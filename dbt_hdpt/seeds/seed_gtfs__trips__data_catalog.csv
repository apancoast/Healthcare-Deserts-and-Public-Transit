service_id,Foreign ID referencing calendar.service_id or calendar_dates.service_id,Required,Identifies a set of dates when service is available for one or more routes.
trip_id,Unique ID,Required,Identifies a trip.
trip_headsign,Text,Optional,"Text that appears on signage identifying the trip's destination to riders. This field is recommended for all services with headsign text displayed on the vehicle which may be used to distinguish amongst trips in a route. If the headsign changes during a trip, values for trip_headsign may be overridden by defining values in stop_times.stop_headsign for specific stop_times along the trip."
direction_id,Enum,Optional,"Indicates the direction of travel for a trip. This field should not be used in routing; it provides a way to separate trips by direction when publishing time tables. Valid options are: 0 - Travel in one direction (e.g. outbound travel).1 - Travel in the opposite direction (e.g. inbound travel).Example: The trip_headsign and direction_id fields may be used together to assign a name to travel in each direction for a set of trips. A trips.txt file could contain these records for use in time tables:  trip_id,...,trip_headsign,direction_id  1234,...,Airport,0  1505,...,Downtown,1"
direction_id_desc,Text,Derived,A descriptive text of the direction_id
block_id,ID,Optional,"Identifies the block to which the trip belongs. A block consists of a single trip or many sequential trips made using the same vehicle, defined by shared service days and block_id. A block_id may have trips with different service days, making distinct blocks. See the example below. To provide in-seat transfers information, transfers of transfer_type 4 should be provided instead."
