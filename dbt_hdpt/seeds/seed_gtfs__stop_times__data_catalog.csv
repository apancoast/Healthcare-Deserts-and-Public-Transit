trip_id,Foreign ID referencing trips.trip_id,Required,Identifies a trip.
arrival_time,Time,Conditionally Required,"Arrival time at the stop (defined by stop_times.stop_id) for a specific trip (defined by stop_times.trip_id) in the time zone specified by agency.agency_timezone, not stops.stop_timezone. If there are not separate times for arrival and departure at a stop, arrival_time and departure_time should be the same. For times occurring after midnight on the service day, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS. If exact arrival and departure times (timepoint=1) are not available, estimated or interpolated arrival and departure times (timepoint=0) should be provided.Conditionally Required:- Required for the first and last stop in a trip (defined by stop_times.stop_sequence). - Required for timepoint=1.- Forbidden when start_pickup_drop_off_window or end_pickup_drop_off_window are defined.- Optional otherwise."
departure_time,Time,Conditionally Required,"Departure time from the stop (defined by stop_times.stop_id) for a specific trip (defined by stop_times.trip_id) in the time zone specified by agency.agency_timezone, not stops.stop_timezone.If there are not separate times for arrival and departure at a stop, arrival_time and departure_time should be the same. For times occurring after midnight on the service day, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS. If exact arrival and departure times (timepoint=1) are not available, estimated or interpolated arrival and departure times (timepoint=0) should be provided.Conditionally Required:- Required for timepoint=1.- Forbidden when start_pickup_drop_off_window or end_pickup_drop_off_window are defined.- Optional otherwise."
stop_id,Foreign ID referencing stops.stop_id,Conditionally Required,"Identifies the serviced stop. All stops serviced during a trip must have a record in stop_times.txt. Referenced locations must be stops/platforms, i.e. their stops.location_type value must be 0 or empty. A stop may be serviced multiple times in the same trip, and multiple trips and routes may service the same stop.On-demand service using stops should be referenced in the sequence in which service is available at those stops. A data consumer should assume that travel is possible from one stop or location to any stop or location later in the trip, provided that the pickup/drop_off_type of each stop_time and the time constraints of each start/end_pickup_drop_off_window do not forbid it.Conditionally Required:- Required if stop_times.location_group_id AND stop_times.location_id are NOT defined.- Forbidden if stop_times.location_group_id or stop_times.location_id are defined."
stop_sequence,Non-negative integer,Required,"Order of stops, location groups, or GeoJSON locations for a particular trip. The values must increase along the trip but do not need to be consecutive.Example: The first location on the trip could have a stop_sequence=1, the second location on the trip could have a stop_sequence=23, the third location could have a stop_sequence=40, and so on.  Travel within the same location group or GeoJSON location requires two records in stop_times.txt with the same location_group_id or location_id."
pickup_type,Enum,Conditionally Forbidden,Indicates pickup method. Valid options are:0 or empty - Regularly scheduled pickup. 1 - No pickup available.2 - Must phone agency to arrange pickup.3 - Must coordinate with driver to arrange pickup.
pickup_type_desc,Text,Derived,A descriptive text of the pickup_type.
drop_off_type,Enum,Conditionally Forbidden,Indicates drop off method. Valid options are:0 or empty - Regularly scheduled drop off.1 - No drop off available.2 - Must phone agency to arrange drop off.3 - Must coordinate with driver to arrange drop off.
drop_off_type_desc,Text,Derived,A descriptive text of the drop_off_type.
timepoint,Enum,Optional,"Indicates if arrival and departure times for a stop are strictly adhered to by the vehicle or if they are instead approximate and/or interpolated times. This field allows a GTFS producer to provide interpolated stop-times, while indicating that the times are approximate. Valid options are:0 - Times are considered approximate. 1 - Times are considered exact.  All records of stop_times.txt with defined arrival or departure times should have timepoint values populated. If no timepoint values are provided, all times are considered exact."
